# Are you a top contributor?

Find out where you rank for a given organization's open source repos.

First, get a [personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new)
with default scopes. Name it, hit "Generate Token", and copy it down.

Now run the program:

    ./main.zsh ORGANIZATION_NAME TOKEN

It will clone down a lot of repos, but it shouldn't take more than maybe 10
seconds to start outputting results.
